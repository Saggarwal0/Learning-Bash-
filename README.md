# ✨☁️🌙 Bash Projects 🌙☁️✨  
“A little universe of scripts where I taught myself Bash, one loop, one crash, one aha! at a time.” 🌸

### 💫 About this Repository  
This is my personal **Bash playground**  a small constellation of projects I built while learning how to make the command line do both **useful** and **fun** things.  

It’s full of little experiments, practical automations, and scripts that make me wonder:  
“Wait… did I just teach my terminal to play dice?” 🎲  

Each project was a small learning step and a reminder that even logic and code can have creativity behind them. ☁️

### 🌟 Highlights  
A few of my favorite scripts floating in here:  
🎲 **Dice Roller** — rolls fair dice (usually)  
🃏 **Deck of Cards** — shuffles a full deck using only shell logic  
🎨 **Using Text & Colors** — because even terminals deserve style  
🧾 **System Logger** — tracks your system stats like a quiet assistant  
🌸 **Tiny Tools & Mini Games** — little side quests that kept things fun

### ☁️ What I Learned  
💻 Writing cleaner, modular Bash scripts  
🌀 Loops, conditionals, and command substitution  
📂 File input/output, permissions, and variables  
💬 Debugging and the power of "echo" (my best friend now)  
💡 Learning how the shell actually *thinks*
